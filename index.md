<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
  I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca">the Data-Driven Decision Making Lab</a> in the University of Toronto. My research lies at the intersection of <strong>intelligent transportation systems</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> -- with a special focus on building adaptive regional traffic control systems based on deep reinforcement learning -- the ultimate goal of which is to alleviate the traffic congestion. My research interests include <strong>deep reinforcement learning</strong>, <strong>traffic flow control</strong> and <strong>spatiotemporal prediction</strong>.
  I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/">Prof. Scott Sanner</a> and <a href="https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/baher-abdulhai/">Prof. Baher Abdulhai</a>. I received my Master's degree in Control Theory and Engineering at <a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Engineering from Beihang University.

Recently, I am working on RAG + Reranking for the on-premise deployment of a QA system for the user manual of a traffic simulator. Stay tuned for the open-source code!

I am actively looking for a machine learning scientist or researcher position to solve real-world problems. I will be on board as of 2025 May. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
