<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at [the Data-Driven Decision Making Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca) in the University of Toronto. My research lies at the intersection of **intelligent transportation systems** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building adaptive traffic perimeter control systems based on deep reinforcement learning -- the ultimate goal of which is to alleviate the traffic congestion. My research interests include **deep reinforcement learning**, **traffic perimeter control** and **spatiotemporal prediction**.

I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) and [Prof. Baher Abdulhai](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/baher-abdulhai/). I received my Master's degree in Control Theory and Engineering at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Engineering from Beihang University.
