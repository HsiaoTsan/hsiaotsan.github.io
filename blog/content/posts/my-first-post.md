## Introduction

What are PPO, GRPO, GSPO, etc? What are their relations? After reading this article, you'll understand:

- **Why**: The motivation for each variant of policy optimization.
- **Connection**: How each algorithm connect to other algorithms in the family.

## Policy Optimization

Proximal Policy Optimization
- actor
- critic

GRPO:
- removed critic
