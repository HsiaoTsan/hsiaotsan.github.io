## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share this new space where I'll be writing about:

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Insights from my research and interesting developments in the field
- **Academic Life**: Experiences and reflections from my Ph.D. journey at the University of Toronto
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Tutorials, code snippets, and technical explanations
- **Research Updates**: Progress on my ongoing projects and publications

## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto, focusing on using AI to solve real-world problems. You can learn more about my academic work and publications on my [homepage](/).

## What to Expect

I plan to post regularly about topics I'm passionate about and things I'm learning along the way. Each post will aim to be informative, practical, and (hopefully) interesting!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any of the topics I write about.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy reading!
