## Introduction

What are PPO, GRPO, GSPO, etc? What are their relations? After reading this article, you'll understand:

- **Why**: The motivation for each variant of policy optimization.
- **Connection**: How each algorithm connect to other algorithms in the XXPO family.

## Policy Optimization

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- actor
- critic

GRPO:
- removed critic, save memory and computation

GSPO:
- sequence level importance sampling

Decoupled PPO:
- use proximal policy for trust region constraint and 

A-3PO:

SPPO:
